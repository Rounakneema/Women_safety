## üõ°Ô∏è SOS Watch: The Wearable Safety Device

The **SOS Watch** is a wearable device specifically designed for women‚Äôs safety, offering a variety of features aimed at providing assistance during emergencies. When activated, it sends real-time alerts and offers continuous support until help arrives. This device is seamlessly integrated with the **Shield_Her** software platform.

### üîë Key Features of the SOS Watch

1. **Geofencing**: 
   - The watch utilizes geofencing to alert authorities if the wearer moves outside a predefined safe zone. 
   - This feature helps ensure safety within designated safe areas and sends an alert if the wearer is taken to an unknown location.

2. **Path Locking**:
   - This feature allows the wearer to set a predefined path when traveling from one location to another. 
   - If the person deviates from the locked path, an alert is immediately triggered, notifying authorities and emergency contacts.

3. **Send Photos**:
   - The watch is equipped with a built-in camera that captures photos automatically when an SOS is triggered.
   - The photos are sent in real-time to the authorities and saved on the cloud for additional security.

4. **Real-Time Voice Streaming**:
   - When the SOS mode is activated, the watch streams live audio from the surrounding environment.
   - This helps authorities and emergency contacts to assess the situation and take swift action based on the live feed.

5. **Voice Activation**:
   - The SOS function can be activated by voice commands, making it easy to use in situations where pressing a button may not be feasible.

6. **Instant SOS Button**:
   - The wearer can also manually activate the SOS function by pressing the button on the watch three times.
   - This immediately sends location details, alerts emergency contacts, and starts the photo and voice stream.

7. **Integration with Shield_Her**:
   - The SOS Watch seamlessly connects with the Shield_Her software system, allowing real-time alerts and monitoring from local authorities.
   - The system can display the wearer‚Äôs location, images, and voice stream in the monitoring application.

## üí° How It Works
1. **Real-Time Processing**: Processes live CCTV feeds to detect people, classify gender, and monitor activity in real-time.
2. **Threat Detection**: Identifies abnormal situations such as women being surrounded by men, lone women in risky environments, or distress gestures.
3. **Alert System**: Sends immediate alerts to local authorities or emergency contacts when threats are detected.
4. **Wearable Device Integration**: The SOS Watch provides a personal, mobile safety net through geofencing, path locking, and real-time audio and image streaming.
